NAME
    CSS::Tiny - Read/Write .css files with as little code as possible

SYNOPSIS
        # In your .css file
        H1 { color: blue }
        H2 { color: red; font-family: Arial }
        .this, .that { color: yellow }
    
        # In your program
        use CSS::Tiny;
    
        # Create a CSS stylesheet
        my $CSS = CSS::Tiny->new();
    
        # Open a CSS stylesheet
        $CSS = CSS::Tiny->read( 'style.css' );
    
        # Reading properties
        my $header_color = $CSS->{H1}->{color};
        my $header2_hashref = $CSS->{H2};
        my $this_color = $CSS->{'.this'}->{color};
        my $that_color = $CSS->{'.that'}->{color};
    
        # Changing styles and properties
        $CSS->{'.newstyle'} = { color => '#FFFFFF' }; # Add a style
        $CSS->{H1}->{color} = 'black';                # Change a property
        delete $CSS->{H2};                            # Delete a style
    
        # Save a CSS stylesheet
        $CSS->write( 'style.css' );
    
        # Get the CSS as a <style>...</style> tag
        $CSS->html;

DESCRIPTION
    "CSS::Tiny" is a perl class to read and write .css stylesheets with as
    little code as possible, reducing load time and memory overhead. CSS.pm
    requires about 2.6 meg or ram to load, which is a large amount of
    overhead if you only want to do trivial things. Memory usage is normally
    scoffed at in Perl, but in my opinion should be at least kept in mind.

    This module is primarily for reading and writing simple files, and
    anything we write shouldn't need to have documentation/comments. If you
    need something with more power, move up to CSS.pm. With the increasing
    complexity of CSS, this is becoming more common, but many situations can
    still live with simple CSS files.

  CSS Feature Support
    "CSS::Tiny" supports grouped styles of the form "this, that { color:
    blue }" correctly when reading, ungrouping them into the hash structure.
    However, it will not restore the grouping should you write the file back
    out. In this case, an entry in the original file of the form

        H1, H2 { color: blue }

    would become

        H1 { color: blue }
        H2 { color: blue }

    "CSS::Tiny" handles nested styles of the form "P EM { color: red }" in
    reads and writes correctly, making the property available in the form

        $CSS->{'P EM'}->{color}

    "CSS::Tiny" ignores comments of the form "/* comment */" on read
    correctly, however these comments will not be written back out to the
    file.

CSS FILE SYNTAX
    Files are written in a relatively human-orientated form, as follows:

        H1 {
            color: blue;
        }
        .this {
            color: red;
            font-size: 10px;
        }
        P EM {
            color: yellow;
        }

    When reading and writing, all property descriptors, for example "color"
    and "font-size" in the example above, are converted to lower case. As an
    example, take the following CSS.

        P {
            Font-Family: Verdana;
        }

    To get the value 'Verdana' from the object $CSS, you should reference
    the key "$CSS->{P}->{font-family}".

METHODS
  new
    The constructor "new" creates and returns an empty "CSS::Tiny" object.

  read $filename
    The "read" constructor reads a CSS stylesheet, and returns a new
    "CSS::Tiny" object containing the properties in the file.

    Returns the object on success, or "undef" on error.

  read_string $string
    The "read_string" constructor reads a CSS stylesheet from a string.

    Returns the object on success, or "undef" on error.

  clone
    The "clone" method creates an identical copy of an existing "CSS::Tiny"
    object.

  write
    The "write $filename" generates the stylesheet for the properties, and
    writes it to disk. Returns true on success. Returns "undef" on error.

  write_string
    Generates the stylesheet for the object and returns it as a string.

  html
    The "html" method generates the CSS, but wrapped in a "style" HTML tag,
    so that it can be dropped directly onto a HTML page.

  xhtml
    The "html" method generates the CSS, but wrapped in a "style" XHTML tag,
    so that it can be dropped directly onto an XHTML page.

  errstr
    When an error occurs, you can retrieve the error message either from the
    $CSS::Tiny::errstr variable, or using the "errstr" method.
